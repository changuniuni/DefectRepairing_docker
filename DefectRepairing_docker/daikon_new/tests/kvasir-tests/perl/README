The perl test case is currently disabled due to a runtime error we
have not had time to diagnose.  On Fedora 20 the runtime outputs:

MISMATCHED on exit_function! f: ..perl_run() !=  perl.c.S_my_exit_jump()
DetectedEntryIP: <STATIC_ADDR> - AssumedEntryIP: <STATIC_ADDR>
DetctedExitIP: <STATIC_ADDR> - AssumedExitIp: <STATIC_ADDR>

On an Ubuntu 14.10 virtual machine it traps into Valgrind and outputs:
